"""
Run the full ANPR pipeline on one or more videos (one per camera) and
send results to the backend.

    python run_video.py




Run this from the REPO ROOT (same folder as the `ai/` directory).

WHAT'S NEW vs your last working version:
  1. Majority-vote OCR aggregation (ai/utils/aggregation.py) instead of
     "keep the single highest-confidence frame" - more consistent plates.
  2. A final MIN_COMBINED_CONFIDENCE gate - low-confidence garbage never
     even reaches the backend, instead of relying only on the per-field
     thresholds inside the pipeline.
  3. Multi-camera support - add a second video to CAMERAS below and this
     script processes both, tagging sightings with different camera_ids.
     Cross-camera correlation needs NO backend changes - your existing
     GET /api/v1/vehicles/{plate} already searches across all cameras.

CPU REALITY CHECK: each camera takes roughly as long as your last run did
(~5 min for a similar-length clip). Two cameras = roughly double the time.
