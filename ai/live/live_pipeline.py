"""
Turns your existing batch pipeline into a "live camera" simulation.

Same detection/OCR/aggregation code as run_video.py - nothing about the
AI model changes. What's different:

  1. The video LOOPS forever instead of stopping at the last frame
     (a real camera never runs out of footage).
  2. A vehicle's plate is finalized and POSTed to the backend the moment
     its track goes idle (hasn't been seen for IDLE_FRAMES frames) -
     i.e. "the car just left the frame" - instead of waiting for the
     entire video to finish. This is what makes alerts/sightings show
     up on the dashboard in near-real-time while the "camera" runs.
  3. Every processed frame (annotated with boxes) is pushed into the
     shared FrameStore so the live MJPEG endpoint can serve it.

Run one of these per camera (see run_live.py), each in its own thread.
