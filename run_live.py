"""
Starts "live monitoring" mode: each camera's video loops forever, gets
processed continuously, and pushes finalized sightings to the backend
in near-real-time (instead of one batch at the end, like run_video.py).

This also exposes the upload endpoint, so footage can be added WHILE
this is running - you don't need to restart anything to bring a new
camera online.

Run from the REPO ROOT, same folder as run_video.py:
    python run_live.py

Before running:
  1. Start the main backend in another terminal:
       cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  2. Keep this process running during your demo - it IS "the cameras".
     Closing it turns every camera off.

Your frontend's Live Monitoring screen should point at (this machine's
address, port 8010):
    GET  http://<host>:8010/live/{camera_id}            <img>/<video> src
    GET  http://<host>:8010/live/status                 online/offline map
    GET  http://<host>:8010/cameras/active               which workers are running
    POST http://<host>:8010/cameras/upload                (multipart form, see below)
    POST http://<host>:8010/cameras/{camera_id}/stop
